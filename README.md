# ReBirth Empowerment Education Employment Platform

### Overview
Our platform is purpose-built for a specific, often overlooked group of individuals who face significant barriers to employment and societal reintegration. Unlike traditional job portals, this platform is exclusively designed to connect them with employers who understand their backgrounds, eliminating the frustration of applying to roles where their unique circumstances might be misunderstood or disregarded.

### Problem We’re Solving
The employment process can be overwhelming for individuals coming from challenging backgrounds. Traditional job sites cater to a broad audience, leaving these individuals to navigate a sea of opportunities that may not be well-suited to their needs. Meanwhile, employers may hesitate to consider applicants from these groups due to stigmas or a lack of understanding.

Our platform addresses this by providing a targeted space where only qualified individuals can apply. Employers posting on our site are fully aware of the applicants’ circumstances, which significantly reduces friction, minimizes mismatched expectations, and helps eliminate biases from the hiring process.

### Features

   - Only eligible applicants can access the application process, ensuring that both applicants and employers are aligned from the start.

2. **Connection and Support**

3. **Resources for Success**

4. **Metrics and Insights for Employers**
